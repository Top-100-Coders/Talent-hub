# Talent Hub: Collaborative Decentralized Talent Discovery prototype with Beckn Protocol

Embark on a revolutionary journey with **Talent Hub**, a collaborative project that seamlessly integrates the **Beckn Protocol** and **Mulearn Karma Ecosystem** for decentralized talent discovery. Developed by a dedicated group of innovators, our project transforms Mulearn's centralized ecosystem into an open network, allowing individuals to host programs, earn karma, and showcase their skills through a discoverable profile.

## Beckn Protocol Integration

At the core of **Talent Hub** is the **Beckn Protocol**, a key enabler that facilitates the conversion of standard APIs for compatibility within open network systems. This integration empowers **Talent Hub** to communicate effortlessly with a diverse range of entities, fostering a decentralized environment for talent discovery.

## Mulearn Karma Ecosystem

Leveraging the **Mulearn Karma Ecosystem**, **Talent Hub** introduces a decentralized talent assessment system. **Karma** serves as a metric for individuals' contributions and skills within the Mulearn ecosystem, providing recruiters with a comprehensive view of each candidate's capabilities and achievements.

## Project Focus: Discoverability of Mulearn Profiles

Our collaborative efforts during the hackathon focused on enhancing the discoverability of Mulearn profiles within the network. **Talent Hub** ensures recruiters can efficiently find their ideal candidates based on Mulearn activities and associated karma scores.

## NOTE
Regrettably, the allotted time for the challenge proved to be more challenging than anticipated, hindering our ability to seamlessly integrate all components of the program. Unforeseen incidents disrupted our progress, and while the individual parts function as demonstrated in the "Proof of Work" directory, we have encountered difficulties in bringing the entire project together. We are committed to completing the integration as soon as possible.
