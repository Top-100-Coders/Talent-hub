# Talent Hub: Collaborative Decentralized Talent Discovery prototype with Beckn Protocol

Embark on a revolutionary journey with **Talent Hub**, a collaborative project that seamlessly integrates the **Beckn Protocol** and **Mulearn Karma Ecosystem** for decentralized talent discovery. Developed by a dedicated group of innovators, our project transforms Mulearn's centralized ecosystem into an open network, allowing individuals to host programs, earn karma, and showcase their skills through a discoverable profile.

## Beckn Protocol Integration

At the core of **Talent Hub** is the **Beckn Protocol**, a key enabler that facilitates the conversion of standard APIs for compatibility within open network systems. This integration empowers **Talent Hub** to communicate effortlessly with a diverse range of entities, fostering a decentralized environment for talent discovery.

## Mulearn Karma Ecosystem

Leveraging the **Mulearn Karma Ecosystem**, **Talent Hub** introduces a decentralized talent assessment system. **Karma** serves as a metric for individuals' contributions and skills within the Mulearn ecosystem, providing recruiters with a comprehensive view of each candidate's capabilities and achievements.

## Project Focus: Discoverability of Mulearn Profiles

Our collaborative efforts during the hackathon focused on enhancing the discoverability of Mulearn profiles within the network. **Talent Hub** ensures recruiters can efficiently find their ideal candidates based on Mulearn activities and associated karma scores.
